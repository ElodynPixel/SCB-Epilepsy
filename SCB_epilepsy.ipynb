            "\n",
            "Epilepsy is a central nervous system (neurological) disorder in which brain activity becomes abnormal, causing seizures or periods of unusual behavior, sensations, and sometimes loss of awareness.\n",
            "\n",
            "Anyone can develop epilepsy. Epilepsy affects both males and females of all races, ethnic backgrounds and ages.\n",
            "\n",
            "Seizure symptoms can vary widely. Some people with epilepsy simply stare blankly for a few seconds during a seizure, while others repeatedly twitch their arms or legs. Having a single seizure doesn't mean you have epilepsy. At least two unprovoked seizures are generally required for an epilepsy diagnosis.\n",
            "\n",
            "Treatment with medications or sometimes surgery can control seizures for the majority of people with epilepsy. Some people require lifelong treatment to control seizures, but for others, the seizures eventually go away. Some children with epilepsy may outgrow the condition with age.\n",
            "\n",
            "Epilepsy care at Mayo Clinic\n",
            "\n",
            "Symptoms\n",
            "\n",
            "Because epilepsy is caused by abnormal activity in the brain, seizures can affect any process your brain coordinates. Seizure signs and symptoms may include:\n",
            "\n",
            "Temporary confusion\n",
            "\n",
            "A staring spell\n",
            "\n",
            "Uncontrollable jerking movements of the arms and legs\n",
            "\n",
            "Loss of consciousness or awareness\n",
            "\n",
            "Psychic symptoms such as fear, anxiety or deja vu\n",
            "\n",
            "Symptoms vary depending on the type of seizure. In most cases, a person with epilepsy will tend to have the same type of seizure each time, so the symptoms will be similar from episode to episode.\n",
            "\n",
            "Doctors generally classify seizures as either focal or generalized, based on how the abnormal brain activity begins.\n",
            "\n",
            "Focal seizures\n",
            "\n",
            "When seizures appear to result from abnormal activity in just one area of your brain, they're called focal (partial) seizures. These seizures fall into two categories:\n",
            "\n",
            "Focal seizures without loss of consciousness. Once called simple partial seizures, these seizures don't cause a loss of consciousness. They may alter emotions or change the way things look, smell, feel, taste or sound. They may also result in involuntary jerking of a body part, such as an arm or leg, and spontaneous sensory symptoms such as tingling, dizziness and flashing lights.\n",

In these cases, it's likely that there's a genetic influence. Researchers have linked some types of epilepsy to specific genes, but for most people, genes are only part of the cause of epilepsy. Certain genes may make a person more sensitive to environmental conditions that trigger seizures.\n",

Car accidents. A seizure that causes either loss of awareness or control can be dangerous if you're driving a car or operating other equipment. Many states have driver's license restrictions related to a driver's ability to control seizures and impose a minimum amount of time that a driver be seizure-free, ranging from months to years, before being allowed to drive.\n",

If you have epilepsy and you're considering becoming pregnant, talk to your doctor as you plan your pregnancy. Most women with epilepsy can become pregnant and have healthy babies. You'll need to be carefully monitored throughout pregnancy, and medications may need to be adjusted. It's very important that you work with your doctor to plan your pregnancy.\n",
